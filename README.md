# TriviaGame

I got stuck on the on-click for this assignment, so I did another one with radio buttons.

I was able to ge the radio buttons to display with the questions.  The great part about this was to have all the questions stored in one array with multiple objects having questions, ansewrs, and correct answer.  

The buttons function, you can click them etc.  

The timer works, it counts down when the page loads.

Missing functionality:

- I was not able to get the grading of the user selection to work.  I created the function but had some trouble
- Reset button and start buttons are not functioning.  
- No initial page load
